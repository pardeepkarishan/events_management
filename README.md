# events_management
I have used codeignitor to create this project. 
For now i have made ui for showing all events list and the ui for adding a new event.  
    As per the requirement i have created Evnet and Location models and coresponding CRUDS for Events and location. And coresponding backend for the same
    For adding a new event i have included Locatoins contrller in the Events conroller because i need location id to be inserted in the events table.  

Link for list of events
//http://localhost/codeint/index.php/Events/index
Link for adding a new event

## User Moled and CRUD is yet need to be implemented.
## All data validation is still left.
